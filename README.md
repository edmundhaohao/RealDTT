# RealDTT
This is the official repository of our paper RealDTT: Towards a Comprehensive Real-World Dataset for Tampered Text Detection. Our dataset encompasses four major categories of tampering techniques—Photoshop, Convolutional Models, GAN Models, and Diffusion Models—comprising ten distinct generation methods.

This dataset is designed for tampered text image research.
